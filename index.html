<h1>Ezat Hamdoun ðŸ¤£ !</h1>
<p>Growing up, My family and I had access to one laptop. I would use the computer to complete school work and entertainment.
    In middle school, I remember taking a computer class which helped with the basics, including typing tests and creating documents. 
    Throughout middle and high school, I would only use the basics, for example, Microsoft word, google docs, and pages.
    I plan on learning and educating myself more on my computer skills as this plays a big role in our generation.
    I joined Refcode to help me develop  coding skills as something I will need in my career.
